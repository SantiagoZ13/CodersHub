# CodersHub:
***

CodersHub is an initiative that merges the passion for programming with the creation of a great online community. It is a platform for programmers and all kinds of people who are passionate about computers and technology. The platform will have blogs to learn topics related to the world of programming and computing, and users will also be able to communicate with each other. I will start with an intuitive and attractive website, initially developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS and Sass to provide an interactive, stable, comfortable and educational space. 

I also want CodersHub to eventually go to the next level by implementing React, a cutting-edge frontend technology created by meta, so I can provide a more dynamic and fluid user experience.
